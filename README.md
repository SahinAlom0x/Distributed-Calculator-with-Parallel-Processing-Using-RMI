# Distributed-Calculator-with-Parallel-Processing-Using-RMI
The Distributed Calculator system showcases the power of distributed computing, parallel processing, and RMI to perform complex mathematical operations efficiently. By leveraging multithreading and distributing computational tasks across multiple servers, the system is able to handle large-scale calculations quickly, even with multiple clients requesting operations concurrently. This approach significantly improves performance, making it suitable for computationally intensive tasks in real-time environments.
### Methodology

1. **System Design**:
   - The system consists of a **server** (hosting mathematical operations) and multiple **clients** (requesting calculations).
2. **Distributed Calculation**:
   - The server implements three operations: **Matrix Multiplication**, **Sorting Large Arrays**, and **Prime Number Finder**.
3. **Multithreading**:
   - On the server side, an **ExecutorService** manages a pool of threads to handle incoming client requests concurrently. Each operation request is processed in a separate thread.
4. **RMI Communication**:
   - Clients initiate communication by looking up the remote `CalculatorServer` object in the RMI registry.
5. **Error Handling**:
   - The system includes basic error handling for scenarios like server unavailability or overload, ensuring that clients receive appropriate error messages or retry mechanisms.
6. **Parallel Execution**:
   - For each task, the server divides the computation into smaller units of work (subtasks), assigns them to threads, and processes them in parallel. This reduces the time required for large calculations.
In summary, this methodology combines **distributed computing**, **RMI**, and **multithreading** to enable fast, concurrent processing of complex calculations across multiple clients and remote servers.
