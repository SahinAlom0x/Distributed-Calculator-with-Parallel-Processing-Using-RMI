# Distributed-Calculator-with-Parallel-Processing-Using-RMI
The Distributed Calculator system showcases the power of distributed computing, parallel processing, and RMI to perform complex mathematical operations efficiently. By leveraging multithreading and distributing computational tasks across multiple servers, the system is able to handle large-scale calculations quickly, even with multiple clients requesting operations concurrently. This approach significantly improves performance, making it suitable for computationally intensive tasks in real-time environments.
### Methodology

1. **System Design**:
   - The system consists of a **server** (hosting mathematical operations) and multiple **clients** (requesting calculations).
   - **RMI (Remote Method Invocation)** is used for communication between clients and the server, allowing clients to invoke server-side methods remotely.
   - The server processes tasks concurrently using **multithreading** to handle multiple requests simultaneously, enhancing throughput.

2. **Distributed Calculation**:
   - The server implements three operations: **Matrix Multiplication**, **Sorting Large Arrays**, and **Prime Number Finder**.
   - Each operation is divided into smaller subtasks, which are then processed in parallel using threads, improving performance and reducing computation time.
   
3. **Multithreading**:
   - On the server side, an **ExecutorService** manages a pool of threads to handle incoming client requests concurrently. Each operation request is processed in a separate thread.
   - For **Matrix Multiplication** and **Sorting Arrays**, the task is split into smaller parts, and each part is computed by a different thread, enabling parallel execution.

4. **RMI Communication**:
   - Clients initiate communication by looking up the remote `CalculatorServer` object in the RMI registry.
   - Clients send requests for operations, which are processed by the server and the results are returned asynchronously.

5. **Error Handling**:
   - The system includes basic error handling for scenarios like server unavailability or overload, ensuring that clients receive appropriate error messages or retry mechanisms.

6. **Parallel Execution**:
   - For each task, the server divides the computation into smaller units of work (subtasks), assigns them to threads, and processes them in parallel. This reduces the time required for large calculations.

In summary, this methodology combines **distributed computing**, **RMI**, and **multithreading** to enable fast, concurrent processing of complex calculations across multiple clients and remote servers.
